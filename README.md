  - White (<50%): No Match

## What is FaceCheck.id?

FaceCheck.id is an online facial recognition tool that enables users to search the web for similar images or profiles by uploading a photo. While the service offers free searches, detailed results such as source links are typically behind a paywall.

## Technical Details

The script works by:
1. Detecting base64-encoded webp images in the page
2. Extracting embedded XMP metadata containing source URLs
3. Processing confidence ratings from the page
4. Grouping related results based on FaceCheck.id's internal grouping system
5. Presenting the data in a user-friendly hover interface with smooth animations
6. Supporting dynamic theme switching based on the `theme` cookie

## Disclaimers

### Accuracy and Reliability
Results accuracy depends entirely on FaceCheck.id's search capabilities and the quality of the embedded metadata. Not all results may contain extractable URLs.
